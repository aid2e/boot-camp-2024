## Version Control System (VCS)

Imagine you are working on a large and complex project. Over time, you make numerous changes, updates, and modifications. Now, what if you want to revert to a previous state of your project or track who made specific changes and why? This is where a Version Control System (VCS) comes into play.

A Version Control System (VCS) is a powerful tool that helps you manage changes to a collection of files. It tracks every modification, allowing you to recall earlier versions of individual files or even the entire project with ease. This capability is crucial for maintaining the integrity and history of your work.

One of the primary goals of a VCS is to facilitate collaborative work. Imagine a team of developers working on the same project, perhaps even the same files, simultaneously. Without a VCS, their changes could easily conflict, leading to confusion and potential loss of work. A VCS allows multiple team members to collaborate seamlessly, ensuring that each person’s contributions are preserved and integrated without affecting others’ work.

Another term often used interchangeably with VCS is Software Configuration Management (SCM) system. While version control is a critical component of SCM, SCM encompasses a broader range of practices and tools. Git, one of the most popular VCS tools, highlights this interchangeability in its official documentation, which can be found at git-scm.com. Although VCSs are predominantly used for software projects, their utility extends to other types of projects, such as books and online tutorials.

With a VCS, you gain several powerful capabilities:

1. **Change Tracking**: See all changes made to your project, including when they were made and who made them. This historical record is invaluable for understanding the evolution of your project.
   
2. **Descriptive Changes**: Each change can include a message explaining the reasoning behind it. This makes it easier to understand the context and purpose of each modification.
   
3. **Version Retrieval**: Retrieve past versions of the entire project or individual files. This feature is essential for reverting to a known good state if something goes wrong or for simply reviewing past work.
   
4. **Branching and Merging**: Create branches to experiment with changes. Branching allows multiple sets of changes (such as new features or bug fixes) to be developed simultaneously, possibly by different team members. Once the changes are tested and validated, they can be merged back into the main branch.
   
5. **Tagging**: Attach tags to specific versions, such as marking a new release. Tags provide an easy way to identify and reference significant points in your project's history.

By using a VCS, you not only maintain a comprehensive history of your project but also enhance collaboration and streamline your workflow. Whether you are working alone or as part of a team, a VCS is an indispensable tool for managing and preserving the integrity of your work.

## What is Git?

Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, the same individual who developed the Linux operating system. Since its inception, Git has been maintained by Junio Hamano, who has played a crucial role in its ongoing development and stability.

To navigate the world of Git, it’s essential to familiarize yourself with its unique terminology. Here’s a concise glossary of terms that you’ll encounter frequently as you delve into Git. Don’t worry about grasping all the details immediately; these terms will become second nature as you progress through the exercises in this book.

### **Working Tree**
The working tree consists of the nested directories and files that make up the project you are currently working on. Think of it as the active workspace where all your changes and edits occur.

### **Repository (Repo)**
The repository, or repo, is the directory at the top level of your working tree where Git stores all the project's history and metadata. A bare repository is a special type of repo that doesn’t include a working tree; it’s typically used for sharing or backups. Bare repos usually have names ending in `.git`, such as `project.git`.

### **Hash**
A hash is a unique number generated by a hash function, representing the contents of a file or another object as a fixed number of digits. Git uses 160-bit hashes (SHA-1) to track changes. By hashing a file's contents and comparing it to a previous hash, Git can determine if the file has changed, regardless of its timestamp.

### **Object**
In a Git repository, there are four types of objects, each identified by a unique SHA-1 hash:
- **Blob Object**: Contains the content of an ordinary file.
- **Tree Object**: Represents a directory and contains names, hashes, and permissions.
- **Commit Object**: Represents a specific version of the working tree.
- **Tag**: A name attached to a commit, marking it for reference.

### **Commit**
To commit, in Git terminology, means to create a commit object. This action is akin to committing changes to a database; it records your changes so that others can eventually see them.

### **Branch**
A branch is a named series of linked commits. The most recent commit in a branch is known as the head. When you initialize a repository, Git creates a default branch called `main`, though it is often named `master`. The head of the current branch is named `HEAD`. Branches enable developers to work independently (or collaboratively) on separate lines of development and later merge their changes into the main branch.

### **Remote**
A remote is a named reference to another Git repository. When you create a repo, Git sets up a default remote named `origin` for push and pull operations.

### **Commands, Subcommands, and Options**
Git operations are executed through commands like `git push` and `git pull`. Here, `git` is the command, and `push` or `pull` is the subcommand specifying the operation you want Git to perform. These subcommands are often accompanied by options, which are indicated with hyphens (-) or double hyphens (--), such as `git reset --hard`.

These terms and others, like `push` and `pull`, will become clearer as you continue learning. Refer back to this glossary as needed to reinforce your understanding while you work through the module.

## Installing `git`

````{tab} Linux
`git` comes default in Linux systems. In a terminal try out
```tcsh
git --version
```
If `git` is not installed by default, then open a terminal and try to install `git` as 
* If Debian/Ubuntu based distributions `sudo apt update && sudo apt install git`
* If Fedora based distributions `sudo dnf install git`
* If Arch based distributions `sudo pacman -S git`
````
````{tab} MacOs
git comes installed by default in MacOs systems. In a termnial try out 
```zsh
git --version
```
If `git` is not installed by default, then open a terminal and try to install `git` as 
* Installing using `brew` installer `brew install git`.
* Alternatively, you can install using Xcode command line tools as `xcode-select --install`
````
````{tab} Windows
* Download the executable from [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
* Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
* Use the default settings unless you have specific requirements.
* Once installed open `cmd.exe` and check out the version `git --version`
````

## Configuring your `git`

1. Open your terminal.
2. Set your username: 
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your username"
```

Do not get confused between `git` and `GitHub`. Git is a distributed version control system primarily used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on projects and manage their revisions efficiently. Git operates locally on your computer, meaning you can work on projects offline and commit changes to your local repository.

GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. It adds a layer of collaboration features on top of Git. GitHub allows you to store your Git repositories in the cloud, making it easier for teams to work together on projects. It provides tools for code review, issue tracking, project management, and integration with other services. GitHub also serves as a platform for open-source community contributions, enabling developers worldwide to share and contribute to projects.
